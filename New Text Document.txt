To create an agent-based model for crystal growth, you could follow these steps:

Define the initial seed (impurity) position and the initial positions of the particles (agents) in continuous space.
At each time step, update the positions of the particles based on a random distribution that models Brownian motion.
Check if any particle is close enough to the crystal (initial seed or previously stuck particles) to get stuck. If so, update the crystal and remove the particle from the simulation.
Repeat steps 2-3 until the desired crystal size is reached or a maximum number of time steps is reached.
To create a cellular automaton for crystal growth, you could follow these steps:

Define a grid with an initial seed (impurity) position and the initial positions of the particles.
At each time step, update the positions of the particles based on a two-dimensional random walk on the grid.
Check if any particle is in a neighboring cell to the crystal (initial seed or previously stuck particles) to get stuck. If so, update the crystal and remove the particle from the simulation.
Repeat steps 2-3 until the desired crystal size is reached or a maximum number of time steps is reached.
These implementations were chosen because they model the essential features of crystal growth: random motion of particles and sticking to the crystal when close enough. The agent-based model allows for more flexibility in modeling continuous space and Brownian motion, while the cellular automaton simplifies the simulation by using a discrete grid.
