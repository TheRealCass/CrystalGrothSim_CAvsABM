### Answer to Quesion 1

An agent-based model (AVM) is a computational model that simulates the actions and interactions of autonomous agents in order to understand complex systems. To create an AVM for this project, we would need to first define the agents and their behavior. We would then need to define the rules for how the agents interact with each other and with their environment

A cellular Atomaton (CA) is a discreate model that consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of a finite number of states. The states of each cell change over time according to a set of rules that depend on the states of the neighbour cells. To develop a CA for crystal growth, we would have to start by defining the grid and the states of the cells  We would then have to define the rules on how the states of each cell chanegs over time. We would then simulate the evaluation of the CA over time

##### ANSWER A

###### Steps to create a AVM for crystal growth
    
* step 1: Defining the agents and their behaviour
    The environment is the solution in which the particles move. The bounderies of the enviornment is the phyical restrians of the breaker containg the liquid

* step 2: Defining the rules of crystal groth
